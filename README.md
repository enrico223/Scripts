# Disclaimer #
Unfortunately I cannot remember where I found the `compiling_files.sh` and the `markdown-preview.sh`, but they are NOT mine.

`is_spotifyd_active.sh` is from [Brodie Robertson](https://github.com/BrodieRobertson).

`sway-launcher-desktop.sh` is from [Bion](https://github.com/Biont/sway-launcher-desktop). 

For `wallpaper_change.sh` be sure to change the variables in the files to mach where your pictures and `hyprpaper.conf` are located.
