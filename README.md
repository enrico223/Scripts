# Disclaimer #
Unfortunately I cannot remember where I found the `compiling_files.sh` and the `markdown-preview.sh`, but they are NOT mine.

`is_spotifyd_active.sh` is from [Brodie Robertson](https://github.com/BrodieRobertson).

`sway-launcher-desktop.sh` is from [Bion](https://github.com/Biont/sway-launcher-desktop).
